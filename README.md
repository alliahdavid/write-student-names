# Write Student Names (C++)

A simple program that prompts the user to enter student names and saves them to a text file (`students.txt`). This project was originally created as a class assignment and later refined into a portfolio project for GitHub. This is Part 1 of a two-part project, where Part 2 will append additional student names to the same file.

## Description

The program asks the user to enter:
- Five student names

It then:
- Writes the names to a file called `students.txt`

This project is useful for learning:
- Basic C++ syntax
- Input/Output operations
- File handling using `ofstream`
- Loops and user input

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC, or Dev-C++)
- Works on Windows, Linux, or macOS

### Installing

2. Open the file in your preferred IDE (Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or VSCode) or text editor.
