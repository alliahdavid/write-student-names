# Write Student Names

A simple C++ program to create a text file and save a list of student names. This program demonstrates basic file handling in C++.

## Description

This program prompts the user to enter five student names and writes them to a text file called `students.txt`. It is designed to teach beginners how to work with file streams (`ofstream`) and handle user input in C++. This project is Part 1 of a two-part series, where Part 2 will append additional student names to the same file.
